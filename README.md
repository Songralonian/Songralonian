## 🏭 Lab Instrument Automation & Data Engineering
🔹 Developing **automated data pipelines** for scientific instruments like TGA, rheometers, and particle sizers.  
🔹 Connecting **industrial equipment (Hirano Coating Line, Wet Milling, PLCs) to PostgreSQL databases**.  
🔹 Using **Python and SQL** to transform lab data into actionable insights.  

## 📊 Data Visualization & Web Interfaces (Work in Progress)
🔹 Designing **interactive lab dashboards** for real-time process monitoring.  
🔹 Creating **custom React + ASP.NET applications** for data management.  
🔹 Leveraging **Apache Superset and Plotly Dash for advanced QC analysis**.  

## 🤖 AI & Machine Learning for Lab Data (Soon to Start)
🔹 Exploring **AI models for predicting material properties** based on lab data.  
🔹 Developing **machine learning algorithms for coatings optimization**.  
🔹 Automating **lab QC analysis with AI-driven anomaly detection**.
